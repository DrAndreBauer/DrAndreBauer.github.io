Our research paper, "[Object Proxy Patterns for Accelerating Distributed Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10776778)", has been published in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. Distributed applications benefit from workflow and serverless frameworks, but advanced data flow optimization is often left to developers—especially as data scales. We propose three high-level proxy-based programming patterns—distributed futures, streaming, and ownership—to simplify and optimize distributed programming. Using benchmarks and scientific applications, we demonstrate significant improvements in runtime, throughput, and memory usage, showcasing the power of these patterns for complex distributed systems.
