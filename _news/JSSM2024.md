Our paper, "[Prediction of Perceived Exertion Ratings in National Level Soccer Players Using Wearable Sensor Data and Machine Learning Techniques](https://www.jssm.org/researchjssm-23-744.xml.xml)", has been accepted in Journal of Sports Science and Medicine. We analyzed 5402 training sessions & 732 matches using 174 parameters (heart rate, GPS, accelerometer, etc.). We compared different techniques and deep learning achieved top perceived exertion ratings predictions, with max heart rate, acceleration & distance covered as key predictors.
